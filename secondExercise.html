      <!--We added an 'input' field that allows the user to type something here;
        add a directive called 'v-on', which tells vuejs to listen to some event;
        input event (fired in every key stroke); and we assign a value to this...
        we call a method 'changeTitle', which is created in the Vue instance.
        Methods is a reserved property of a Vue instance. We can create methods,
        which is an object. We can put 'changeTitle' function in here.
        'this.title'... 'this' refers to the 'data' object. It 
        proxies all data properties (like title) to the top Vue instance object
        automatically. Vanilla JS. 
        'event' is a default object created by JS.
        'event' has a 'target' property and target will be the input field
        of which we know it'll have a 'value' property which the user will input.
